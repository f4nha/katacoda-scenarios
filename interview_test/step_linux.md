### Task - Linux questions 

1. Change default umask so the new directories created come with 700 permissions. (runtime & permanent).

2. Find all files matching years between 2017 and 2029 on /tmp/data/pod-*.

3. Check why you cannot reach www.google.com? (curl or ping).

4. Export a certificate from a website and create your own .crt or .pem ? (tip: using openssl).

5. drop all connections going out to bbc.co.uk (whichever ip it is) on port 443 and test.

Extra
- please remove the file name '   ' on /tmp
- Is it safe to attach the strace to a running process on the production? What are the consequences?
