### Task - Linux questions 

1. Change default umask so the new directories created come with 700 permissions. (runtime & permanent).

2. Find all files matching years 2017 and 2019 on /tmp/data/pod-*.

3. Check why you cannot reach www.google.com? (curl or ping).

4. Export a certificate from a website and create your own .crt or .pem ? (tip: using openssl).

5. Drop all connections going out to bbc.co.uk (whichever ip it is) on port 443 and test.

6. List all user ids which are lower than 1000 using preferably one-line command. (tip: using awk)

Extra
- Other admin trying to debug a server accidentally typed: `chmod -x /bin/chmod.` How to reset permissions back to default?
- Is it safe to attach the strace to a running process on the production? What are the consequences?
